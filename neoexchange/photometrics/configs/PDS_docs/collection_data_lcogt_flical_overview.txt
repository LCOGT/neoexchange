Las Cumbres Observatory fli Calibrated Data Collection Overview

Data Abstract
=============

We obtained images of the NEO (65803) Didymos binary asteroid and the resulting
plume of debris from the impact of the DART spacecraft with Dimorphos, along
with supporting calibration data, from the three 1 meter Las Cumbres 
Observatory (LCOGT) telescopes at the site in South Africa. These images were
obtained to supplement the NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART)
mission. The DART mission was a planetary defense mission designed to
test and measure the deflection caused by a kinetic impactor (the
spacecraft) on the orbit of Dimorphos asteroid around its primary,
Didymos. These ground-based observations from the date of impact (2022-09-26 UTC)
were used to obtain three color measurements and light curves of Didymos and
the resulting debris plume after the impact of the DART spacecraft. This
collection consists of the Las Cumbres Observatory calibrated images
and the supporting calibration frames: master bias and dark frames and
the master flat field images.

Data Set Overview
=================

Due to the time of the DART impact (2022-09-26 23:14 UTC), all data is from the
night of 2022-09-26 at the LCOGT South Africa (cpt; see Naming Convention) site
covering the time period 2022-09-26T23:00 to 2022-09-27T02:57 and the following
telescopes and FLI instruments (see Naming Convention below for explanation):

* CPT 1m0 #10 (cpt1m010) telescope and ef02 instrument in Dome A (721 g' frames)
* CPT 1m0 #13 (cpt1m013) telescope and ef03 instrument in Dome B (620 i' frames)
* CPT 1m0 #12 (cpt1m012) telescope and ef04 instrument in Dome C (672 clear frames)

The FLI imaging instruments are a 1k x 1k CCD that images a 5.8 arcminute square
field of view. The CCDs are back illuminated and have 13-micron pixels. The
unbinned detector provides a pixel scale of 0.340 arcsec/pixel but for the vast
majority of these observations, the instrument was operated in 2x2 pixel binning,
giving 0.680 arcsec/pixel. 

(Due to the nature of the way these observations were scheduled in 
blocks of ~40 minutes long, the frames consist of a repeating set of 2, 
10 & 30s exposures in bin2x2 mode, followed by a "reset" exposure of 
0.2s in the clear filter to set the instrument back to its regular 
autoguider mode. All of the data were taken tracking Didymos (indicated 
by SRCTYPE='MINORPLANET' as opposed to SRCTYPE='EXTRASOLAR' for 
sidereally-tracked data) at the full on-sky rate (indicated by the 
tracking fraction keyword TRACFRAC=1.0 in the header) but the very 
short "reset" expsoures do not show any evidence of the trailing caused 
by the non-sidereal tracking).

Raw image data (see data_lcogt_fliraw_fli_collection) are calibrated through
two pipelines, the observatory-wide BANZAI pipeline (McCully, C. et al.
2018.  Real-time processing of the imaging data from the network of Las
Cumbres Observatory Telescopes using BANZAI. Proceedings of the SPIE,
10707, 107070K) and then the NEOExchange Solar System Pipeline
(Lister, T. et al. 2021.  NEOExchange - an online portal for NEO and
Solar System science. Icarus, 364, 114387). BANZAI
is used  to perform the basic calibration steps of:
1. Overscan subtraction: all images with a valid BIASSEC header keyword
have a median value removed estimated from the BIASSEC region
2. Gain correction: All pixels in the frame are multiplied by the gain,
using the GAIN header keyword. Thus, the science frames output by
BANZAI are all in units of electrons.
3. Trim: In this step, the data is trimmed to a usable region
for science. This is set based on the TRIMSEC header keyword.
4. Bias Subtraction: Full frame master bias images are subtracted from
each of the darks, flat field images, and science frames. The master
bias frame that was taken closest in time to the current data will be
used. 
5. Dark Subtraction: Full-frame master dark frames, scaled to the
exposure time of the frame, are subtracted from all flat-field and
science images. The most recent master dark frame is used, normally
this is taken on the same day.
6. Flat Field Correction: Master flat field images (normalized to unity
using the inner quarter of the image) are divided out of every science
frame. The most recent master flat-field image for the given telescope,
filter, and binning is used.

The NEOexchange pipeline performs source detection in the images using 
SExtractor (Bertin, E and Arnouts, S. 1996. SExtractor: Software for 
source extraction. A&AS, 117, 393), astrometric fits to the detected 
sources based on the known positions of Gaia DR2 stars in the field 
using SCAMP (Bertin, E. 2006.  Automatic Astrometric and Photometric 
Calibration with SCAMP. ASPC, 351,112), photometrically calibrates the 
zero point of the images based on the measured flux of field stars that 
have known catalog magnitudes (from Gaia-DR2 catalogs for these data), 
and then using these astrometric and photometric solutions derives a 
calibrated magnitude for Didymos. Due to the small field of view and 
sometime use of short (2s) exposures, some of the frames did not solve 
astrometrically. This is indicated in the FITS header by the WCSERR 
keyword having a non-zero value. The photometry tables included in 
Derived Data Product data_lcogt_fliddp collection are the output of 
these pipelines.

Naming Convention
=================

Calibrated FLI images consist of a single FITS file containing a primary
header and a single image.
They are named according to the following LCOGT-wide convention:
<site><tel. class><tel. #>-<instrument>-<yyyymmdd>-<iiii>-<type><red. level>.<extn>
where:

filename section Description
---------------- --------------------------------------------------------------
<site>           LCOGT site code (one from {ogg, coj, lsc, cpt, elp, tfn, ngq})
<tel. class>     Size/class of telescope (one from {2m0, 1m0, 0m4})
<tel. #>         telescope serial number within size class
<instrument>     LCOGT instrument code e.g. ‘ef15’ where the first letter
indicates CCD manufacturer (e=e2v), second letter indicates controller
manufacturer (f=FLI) and the 2 digits indicate serial number.
<yyyymmdd>       UTC date of the start of the night (defined to be UTC
date at 1600 local time at the site). Does not change if the site
observes through UTC midnight.
<iiii>           four digit image counter for that instrument, resets
at start of new night (defined as above). Counter starts at 0001
<type>           Type of file. One of {a=arc, b=bias, d=dark, e=exposure,
s=standard, f=sky flat, l=lambert flat, w=lamp flat, x=experimental})
<red level>      Reduction level from 00-99 with higher numbers
indicating higher levels of data processing. In practice, one of
{00=raw, 91=BANZAI processed, 92=NEOexchange processed}
<extn>           the file extension. ".fits" for fits file format,
".xml" for the PDS label.

e.g. cpt1m012-ef04-20220926-0176-e92.fits is a NEOexchange processed
expose(sky) data product from the SAAO Observatory, Sutherland (cpt), from
1-meter telescope #12 and the ef04 FLI instrument from the night
of 2022-09-26. It is the 176th image taken by that instrument on that
night.

The LCOGT site codes (which are based on the IATA code of the nearest
airport) are defined as follows:

LCOGT     Site 
Site code location description
--------- -----------------------------------------------------------------
ogg       Haleakala, Maui, HI, USA
coj       Siding Spring Observatory, NSW, Australia
lsc       Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, Chile
cpt       South African Astronomical Observatory, Sutherland, South Africa
elp       McDonald Observatory, Texas, USA
tfn       Teide Observatory, Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain
ngq       Ali Observatory, western Tibet, China
sin       Meta site for all Sinistro cameras in the network

For these data, due to the time of the DART impact (2022-09-26 23:14 UTC), all
data is from the cpt site and the following telescopes and instruments:
* CPT 1m0 #10 (cpt1m010) telescope and ef02 instrument in Dome A
* CPT 1m0 #13 (cpt1m013) telescope and ef03 instrument in Dome B
* CPT 1m0 #12 (cpt1m012) telescope and ef04 instrument in Dome C

Master Bias, Dark and Flat Field Frames
=======================================

BANZAI creates the master bias, dark and flat frames required for the
reduction of science frames. For all instruments, we take many
full-frame bias and dark exposures every afternoon and morning. We use
a “robust standard deviation” (rstd) based on the median absolute
deviation (mad - related to the std by σ≈1.4826×mad) to estimate the
scatter of the distribution and mask pixels more than 3 rstd reliably
and take a mean of the remaining pixels as usual. When creating the
master dark frame, each individual frame is scaled by the exposure time
(read from the header).

Twilight flats are taken every day but not in every filter, because
twilight is not long enough to take all 11 filters in a single night.
For the FLI instrument observations, flat fields in the g', i' and clear
filters used were scheduled in the two weeks leading up to the DART impact.
The frames are dithered so that we can remove stars in the combined
master flat field.

Each individual flat-field image is normalized to unity before
combining them. The normalization is calculated finding the robust
sigma clipped mean (3.5 rstd outliers are rejected) of the central
region of the image. For the central region, we choose the central 25%
of the field (the region has dimensions that are half of the full
image). The flat-field frames are then stacked using a sigma clipped
mean, similar to the master bias and dark frames, again with 3 rstd
outlier rejection.

The naming scheme for the master calibration frames follow the same
general format as the Calibrated Images described above but the <type>
and <reduction level> sections are replaced by:
<calib type>-<readout speed (Opt.)>-bin<X binning>x<Y binning>-<filter>

where <calib type> for master calibration frames is one of {bpm (bad 
pixel mask), bias (master bias), dark (master dark), skyflat (master 
sky flatfield)}, <readout speed> (optional) and <filter> is only 
present for skyflat calibration types. Some examples of these 
combinations are:
cpt1m012-ef04-20210402-dark-2_mhz-bin1x1.fits and
cpt1m012-ef04-20210402-bias-2_mhz-bin1x1.fits
which are master dark and bias calibration frames for 1x1 binning with 
the 2 MHz readout speed from LCOGT 1m #12 in South Africa (cpt site) 
from 2021-04-02. (In order to comply with PDS label requirements, the 
filename is forced to lowercase so the readout speed will be altered 
from the actual '2_MHz' (2 megahertz) in the original filename to 
'2_mhz' in the PDS collection.
