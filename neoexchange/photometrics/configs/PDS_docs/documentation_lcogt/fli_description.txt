Las Cumbres Observatory FLI Imager
==================================

  Instrument Overview
  ===================

    The ancilliary autoguider cameras for the main visible-wavelength,
    direct-imaging CCD Sinistro instruments for the Las Cumbres
    Observatory (LCOGT) 1-meter Telescopes are called the FLI Imagers.
    The FLI imagers compromise a Finger Lakes Instrumentation (FLI) ML4720 
    camera containing a e2v back-illuminated monolithic frame transfer CCD with 
    1024 x 1024 x 13um pixels combined with a LCOGT constructed corrector, focus
    stage and filterwheel. The instrument is mounted on one of the
    side ports on the LCOGT 1-meter instrument support structure.

  Detector                                                         
  ========      
    The FLI imager is a 1k x 1k CCD that images a 5.8 arc minute square field of
    view. The device is back illuminated and has 13-micron pixels. The unbinned
    detector provides a pixel scale of 0.340 arcsec/pixel. The instrument
    can be operated in 1x1 or 2x2 pixel binning, giving 0.680 arcsec/pixel.
    The chip is linear up to 65k ADU and has dual amplifiers 
    which can readout at either 500 kHz or 2MHz. Read noise is typically 7.5 
    electrons with 500 kHz readout and 16.3 electrons in 2 MHz readout. The 
    readout and processing time is 2.1 seconds for unbinned images, and 
    1.78 seconds for the binned 2x2 mode. The CCD quantum efficiency is 15% for 
    300-350 nm, 50% at 400, 90% at 500 nm, rising to 90-95% over 500-700 nm and
    declining smoothly to 12% at 1000 nm.

  Filters                                                         
  =======
    A single ten position filter wheel in the FLI instrument provide 9
    filter slots. A common set of filters are provided in all the FLI
    imagers including the Bessell B and V and Sloan/PanSTARRS g’r’i’zs along
    with a 'clear' broad filter with a very sharp cut-on at 400nm and a roll-off
    at 1000nm down to ~50% transmission at 1200nm.
