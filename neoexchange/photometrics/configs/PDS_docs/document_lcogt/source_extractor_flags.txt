Flag values are generated by SExtractor during the generation of 
photometry data. The flag value is a bitmask created by treating each 
separate flag condition as a bit flag as a power of 2 coded in decimal, 
with the overall value determined by the sum of which flags are enabled 
or disabled. The bits and conditions are organized in order of 
increasing concern, starting at bit 0.

The following table shows the bit number and value that a single 
condition contributes to the extractor flag value. Note that this means 
more than one condition can be reported by the flag value.

Bit | Value | Meaning
0   |   1   | Aperture photometry is likely to be biased by neighboring sources or by more than 10% of bad pixels in any aperture
1   |   2   | The object has been deblended
2   |   4   | At least one object pixel is saturated
3   |   8   | The isophotal footprint of the detected object is truncated (too close to an image boundary)
4   |  16   | At least one photometric aperture is incomplete or corrupted (hitting buffer or memory limits)
5   |  32   | The isophotal footprint is incomplete or corrupted (hitting buffer or memory limits)
6   |  64   | A memory overflow occurred during deblending
7   | 128   | A memory overflow occurred during extraction


For example, a value of 1 indicates that the condition associated with 
bit 0 has been flagged. Another example: a value of 3 indicates that 
the conditions associated with bits 0 and 1 have been flagged. As a 
final example, a value of 70 indicates that the conditions associated 
with bits 1, 2, and 6 have been flagged.
