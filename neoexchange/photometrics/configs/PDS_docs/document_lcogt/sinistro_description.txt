Las Cumbres Observatory Sinistro Imager
=======================================

  Instrument Overview
  ===================

    The visible-wavelength, direct-imaging CCD instruments for the Las Cumbres
    Observatory (LCOGT) 1-meter Telescopes are called the Sinistro Imagers.
    Sinistro imagers contain a Fairchild deep depletion, back-illuminated
    monolithic CCD with 4096 x 4097 pixels. The instrument is mounted on the
    straight through port on the LCOGT 1-meter instrument support structure.

  Detector
  ========
    Sinistro is a 4k x 4k CCD that images a 26.5 arc minute square field of
    view. The device is back illuminated and has 15-micron pixels. The unbinned
    detector provides a pixel scale of 0.389 arcsec/pixel. The instrument
    can also be operated in a central_2k_2x2 mode which reads the central
    2048 x 2048 pixels, with 2x2 pixel binning, giving 0.778 arcsec/pixel.
    The chip is linear up to 65k ADU and the gains of the four individual
    amplifiers are normalized to 1.0 by the processing pipeline for calibrated
    images. Read noise is typically 7.5 to 9 electrons depending on the
    particular CCD and the readout time is 28 seconds for unbinned images, and
    9 sec for the central_2k_2x2 mode. The CCD quantum efficiency is 64% for
    350 - 400 nm, 72% at 500 nm, rising to 80-90% over 600-800 nm and declining
    to 24% at 1000 nm. The quantum efficiency falls off very sharply below 350 nm.

  Filters
  =======
    Three eight position filter wheels in the Sinsitro instrument provide 21
    filter slots. A common set of filters are provided in all the Sinistro
    imagers including the Bessell UBVRI and Sloan/PanSTARRS u’g’r’i’zs along
    with a PanSTARRS w broad filter equivalent to g’+r’+i’.
