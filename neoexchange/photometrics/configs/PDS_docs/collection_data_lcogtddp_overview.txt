Las Cumbres Observatory Derived Data Product Collection

Data Abstract
=============

We obtained images of the NEO (65803) Didymos binary asteroid and
supporting calibration data with the Las Cumbres Observatory global
telescope (LCOGT) network through several filters. These images were
obtained in support of NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART)
mission. The DART mission was a planetary defense mission designed to
test and measure the deflection caused by a kinetic impactor (the
spacecraft) on the orbit of Dimorphos asteroid around its primary,
Didymos. These ground-based observations were used to obtain light
curves of Didymos and time the mutual events of Dimorphos to determine
the period change caused by the impact of the DART spacecraft. This
collection consists of the Las Cumbres Observatory photometry summary
tables, which are a PDS4 derived product.

Data Set Overview
=================

Imaging data were collected with the Sinistro imagers on the LCOGT 1m 
telescope network between 2022-07-31 and 2023-01-27 UTC for measuring 
lightcurves of the Didymos system. In total there are 47 
"telescope-night" combinations of data (in individual directories), 
although not all were usable for measuring lightcurves and determining 
mutual event times to the required precision. In particular the following
datasets didn't produce usable photometry:
lcogt_1m0_06_fa07_20221231 (from the 1m in Dome B at the ELP site)
lcogt_1m0_08_fa05_20230101 (from the 1m in Dome A at the ELP site)
See the dart_teleobs:data_lcogtraw overview.txt document for more details on
the Sinistro imagers and filters used.

The photometry of Didymos is measured from the calibrated frames (see 
date_lcogtcal collection) using the NEOexchange or PHOTOMETRYPIPELINE 
pipelines. Both perform source detection in the images using SExtractor 
(Bertin, E and Arnouts, S. 1996. SExtractor: Software for source 
extraction. A&AS, 117, 393), astrometric fits to the detected sources 
based on the known positions of Gaia DR2 stars in the field using SCAMP 
(Bertin, E. 2006.  Automatic Astrometric and Photometric Calibration 
with SCAMP. ASPC, 351,112), photometrically calibrates the zero point 
of the images based on the measured flux of field stars that have known 
catalog magnitudes (typically from either the PanSTARRS or Gaia-DR2 
catalogs), and then using these astrometric and photometric solutions 
to convert to PanSTARRS r magnitudes and derive a calibrated magnitude 
for Didymos. The photometry tables included in this collection are the 
output of these pipelines.

The photometry summary table is named according to the following convention: 
lcogt_<site>_<inst.>_<YYYYMMDD>_<request #>_<astname#>_photometry.tab
where:
* <site> is the LCOGT site code as defined in the table below,
* <inst.> is the LCOGT instrument code e.g. ‘fa15’ where the first letter
indicates CCD manufacturer (f=Fairchild), second letter indicates controller
manufacturer (a=Archon) and the 2 digits indicate serial number,
* <YYYYMMDD> is the date of the start of data collection for that night,
* <request number> is the unique LCOGT (integer) identifier assigned to the observation
request by the LCOGT Observing Portal
* <astname#> is the asteroid name and number in PDS-compatible identifier format i.e. all
lowercase

An example would be lcogt_lsc_fa15_20220730_2956963_65803didymos_photometry.tab
for a photometry file for (65803) Didymos from the fa15 instrument at
Cerro Tololo (site code 'lsc') from 2022-07-30.

The LCOGT site codes (which are based on the IATA code of the nearest
airport) are defined as follows:

LCOGT     Site

ogg       Haleakala, Maui, HI, USA
coj       Siding Spring Observatory, NSW, Australia

Photometry data are stored as a PDS4 ASCII fixed-width table according to the 
following format. 

validity_flag: Flag whether this is a valid photometric datapoint, # indicates
probably invalid blended data due to asteroid interference with the star.
file: file name of the calibrated image where data were measured
julian date: Julian date of the exposure midtime
mag: Calibrated PanSTARRS r-band apparent magnitude of Didymos
sig: 1-sigma error on the apparent magnitude 
ZP: Calibrated zero point magnitude in PanSTARRS r-band
ZP_sig: 1-sigma error on the zero point magnitude
inst_mag:  Instrumental magnitude of Didymos 
inst_sig: 1-sigma error on the instrumental magnitude
SExtractor_flag: Flags associated with the Source Extractor photometry 
measurements, see source_extractor_flags.txt in the documents folder for this 
archive for more detailed description.
aprad: Radius in pixels of the aperture used for the photometry measurement
